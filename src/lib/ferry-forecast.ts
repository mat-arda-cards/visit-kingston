// Heuristic busyness forecast for the Edmonds–Kingston car ferry.
//
// WSF publishes LIVE data (drive-up space, wait notes) only for the next few
// sailings *today* — there is no API that says how busy a future Saturday will
// be. So this module is an ESTIMATE, not a measurement: a deterministic model
// of the route's well-documented traffic rhythms — directional commute peaks,
// weekend leisure surges, the summer season, and the worst holidays — that lets
// a visitor plan a trip days or weeks out. Every surface that renders it must
// label it an estimate and defer to the live board / WSDOT for the real thing.
//
// It is intentionally PURE and client-safe (no fetch, no env, no server-only
// imports) so the planner can recompute instantly in the browser as the visitor
// drags the time or flips direction, and so SSR and hydration agree.
//
// Calibrated (July 2026) against WSF's own "Best Times to Travel" per-sailing
// vehicle-traffic grid for Summer 2026 — the authoritative day-of-week ×
// departure-time busyness source — cross-checked by adversarial web research.
// Its four tiers map to the score bands here: Unlikely to Fill ≈ Light,
// Sometimes Full ≈ Moderate, Often Full ≈ Busy, Likely Full ≈ Very busy;
// season/holiday multipliers push the worst days into Extreme.
//
// Capacity context: the route normally runs two ~188-vehicle Jumbo-class boats
// (~376 cars/sailing); the car deck — not the passenger cabin — is always the
// binding constraint, which is why walk-ons effectively always board. One case
// this model CAN'T see is a small substitute vessel (e.g. a 64-car boat), which
// causes severe waits on any day; the live board is the authority for that.
// The constants below are the tunable knobs — feed in sailing-space history if
// it's ever collected.
